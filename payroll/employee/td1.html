<p>Form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return, must be filled out when individuals start a new job or they want to increase/reduce income tax deductions so that employers or payers pay individuals accurately. This is used to calculate the amount of tax to be deducted from their employment income or other income, such as pension income.</p>

 <h2 id="h-00">Who should fill out TD1 forms</h2>
<p>Individuals must fill out the federal TD1 form if they: </p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">Have a new employer or payer </li>
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">Want to change amounts from previous claimed </li>
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">Want to claim the deduction for living in a prescribed zone </li>
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">Want to increase the amount of tax deducted at source </li>
</ul>

</p>If more than the basic personal amount is claimed, the individual must also fill out a provincial or territorial TD1 form.</p>
	
<h3>What is the purpose of the TD1-WS worksheet</h3>
<p>TD1-WS worksheets are used to calculate partial credits on the TD1 form for the following amounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic personal amount</li>
<li>Age amount  </li>
<li>Canada caregiver amount for eligible dependent or spouse or common-law partner </li>
<li>Canada caregiver amount for dependent(s) age 18 or older </li>
</ul>
<p> Individuals keep this worksheet for their records. It is <strong>not </strong>given to their employer or payer.</p>
	

		 <h2 id="h-0">When to fill out the TD1 forms</h2> 
 <p>Employers and payers must get the completed TD1 forms from the individual <strong>within seven days</strong> of:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">When the employee starts work</li>
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">Any change that happens to the individual's personal tax credits</li></ul>
<p>Individuals <strong>do not</strong> have to fill out a new TD1 every year unless there is a change to their federal, provincial or territorial personal tax credit amounts.</p>

<summary>Form TD1X: To be filled out by employees that are paid by commission </span></summary>
<p>In addition to the federal TD1 form, <strong>employees paid by commissions </strong>and who claim expenses can elect to use Form TD1X, Statement of Commission Income and Expenses for Payroll Tax Deductions, to take into consideration the expenses in the calculation of their income tax. </p>	
<p>Some employees receive commission cheques instead of, or in addition to, regular pay cheques.</p>

<p>Commission is normally a percentage of sales or a fixed amount. </p>
<p>Commission can either be paid regularly or irregularly. </p>
</ul>
<details><summary>Examples: Irregular and regular payment</p></summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irregular payment</strong>: A salesperson who receives a commission cheque based on their sales could receive two cheques in one month and not have any in the next month.</li>
<li><p><strong>Regular payment</strong>: A salesperson who receives their commission cheque on a set schedule such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The last Friday of every month </li>
<li>With every salary pay cheque (if applicable) </li>
<li>At the end of every fiscal quarter </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>

<h3>How to elect to use the TD1X</h3>
<p>To elect, employees must fill out the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/td1x.html">TD1X, Statement of Commission Income and Expenses for Payroll Tax Deductions</a>.</p>

 <p>For employees in Quebec, they must fill out the <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/online-services/forms-and-publications/current-details/tp-1015-3-v">TP-1015.R.13.1-V, Statement of Commissions and Expenses for Source Deduction Purposes (Revenu Quebec)</a>.</p>
                                        
 
<h3 id="h_0_1">When to fill out and send the TD1X</h3>
<p>When filling out the TD1X, the employee will estimate the income and expenses by using <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm mrgn-bttm-lg">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">The current year's estimated figures </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The previous year's figures if they were paid by commission in that year </li>
</ul>
<p>The employee must send the TD1X to the employer no later than:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">Within one month of the date their employment starts </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">January 31 if with the same employer as the previous year </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Within one month of the date of any changes to their personal tax credit amounts as shown on the TD1 </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Within one month of the date of a substantial change in the estimated total remuneration or estimated commission expenses </li>
</ul>


<h3>How to revoke the TD1X</h3>
<p>The employee can revoke the TD1X at any time during the year by informing their employer in writing. Once revoked, the employer will deduct tax using the total claim amount on the <strong>TD1</strong>. </p>

<summary>TD1-IN: To be filled out by employees who are Indians </span></summary>
<p>We recognize that many First Nations people in Canada prefer not to describe themselves as Indians. However, we use the term "Indian" because it has a legal meaning in the Indian Act.</p>

<p>In addition to the federal TD1 form, <strong>Indians </strong> who want to determine if their income is taxable should fill out Form TD1-IN, Determination of Exemption of an Indian's Employment Income.</p>

<h2 id="h-2">Electronic or paper TD1 forms</h2>
 <details> <summary>Electronic TD1 forms you created</summary>
<p>You may create a federal and a provincial or territorial Form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return, and have the individual send it to you electronically instead of giving paper copies of Form TD1 to the individual.</p>

<p>The following conditions must <strong>all</strong> be met:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>You can create, maintain and store the TD1 Personal Tax Credits Return forms electronically.</li>
<li>Security measures must be in place to authenticate the individual's identity because there is no written signature on the TD1 Form (for example, a password system or an individual self-service portal).</li></ul>
<p>In addition to the above conditions, the electronic forms must:</p>

<ul>
<li> Be made available and accessible to the CRA when requested and be maintained in a format that can be read by representatives of the CRA. </li>
<li> Mirrors the CRA approved TD1 paper form </li>
<li> Include a certification confirming that the information given by the individual is accurate. For example, clicking on a button saying "I agree" to a statement that is similar to the certification statement on the paper Form TD1 return (i.e. the information is correct and complete to the best of his or her knowledge) </li>
<li> Be in a format that cannot be altered, meaning that changes can only be made if the individual submits a new Form TD1 </li>
<li> Include a date so you can tell when the individual submits a new Form TD1 to you </li>
<li> Meets all of the CRA's general guidelines on record retention and on electronic records, which can be found in information circular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic78-10.html">IC78-10R, Books and Records Retention/Destruction</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the electronic form will not relieve you of your responsibility to review the completed forms for reasonableness. </p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Online or paper TD1 forms</summary>
<p>You can give the link to the webpage or give paper copies of the appropriate TD1 forms to the individual. </p>
</details>

 

 <h2 id="h-4">What if you do not receive the form</h2>

<p>If an individual does not give the completed Form TD1, the individual's tax deductions will only include the basic personal amount you estimated based on their income. You still need to:</p>

<ul>
<li> Determine which tax tables to use </li>
<li>Calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li></ul>
<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>If the individual does provide you with a form, they may be penalized $25 for each day the form is late. The minimum penalty is $100, and increases by $25 per day to the maximum of $2,500.</p>


<h2 id="h-5">After receiving the forms</h2>
<p>You need to:</p>
<ol class="lst-stps">
<li>Review the back of the TD1 form to make sure the individual has not included any <strong>additional </strong>information (for example, requesting additional tax to be deducted). </li>
<li>Review the back of the TD1 form to make sure the box <strong>More than one employer or payer at the same time </strong>is not checked. If the box is checked and the employee's total income from all sources will be <strong>more </strong>than the personal tax credits claimed on another TD1 form, you must enter <strong>zero </strong>on the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>line. This is because individuals with multiple employers cannot claim the basic personal amount with more than <strong>one </strong>employer <strong>unless </strong>their combined annual earnings will be <strong>less </strong>than the basic personal amount </li>
<li>Use the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>from the TD1 form to calculate the correct amount of federal and provincial or territorial income tax deductions </li>
<li>Keep the completed forms with the individual's records. <strong>Do not </strong>send the CRA a copy. </li>
<li>Determine which tax tables to use </li>
<li>Calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li>
</ol>

<p>A new form will be required within <strong>seven days </strong>of any changes to the individual's personal tax credits. </p>
