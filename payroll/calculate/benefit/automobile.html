<li><h3 id="h_2">Determine if a benefit is taxable</h3>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-lg">Generally, if your employee uses one of your automobile it is a taxable benefit. Depending on your situation, the benefit may not be taxable under the <a href="#adminpolicy" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">CRA's administrative policy&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>. </p>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide your employee with an automobile that you own or lease and your employee uses the automobile for <strong>business use only</strong>, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable.</p>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you provide your employee with an automobile that you own or lease and your employee uses the automobile for <strong>both business and personal purposes</strong>, the personal use is a taxable benefit.</p>
<details><summary>What is considered personal use (personal driving)</summary>
<div id="ajax-personal">
<p>Personal driving is any driving by an employee, or a person related to the employee, for purposes not related to their employment.</p>
<p>An employee may use one of your owned or leased vehicles for purposes other than business or, an employee may use their personal vehicle to carry out employment duties and get an allowance for the business use of that vehicle. Whatever the situation, if your employee drives your vehicle for personal reasons or you reimburse your employee for the personal driving of their own vehicle, there is a taxable benefit that has to be calculated and included in their income.</p>

<p>The following are examples of personal use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vacation trips </li>
<li>Driving to conduct personal activities </li>
<li>Travel between home and a regular place of employment, <strong>other than a point of call</strong> </li>
<li>Travel between home and a regular place of employment even if you insist the employee drive the vehicle home, for example:
<ul>
<li>the employee is on 24 hour call </li>
<li>the employer feels the security of the vehicle and its contents is better served at the employee's residence </li>
<li>it is more convenient or economical to have the vehicle driven to the employee's residence </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Example 1</h5>
<p>ABC Restaurant Inc. uses a van that has been specially modified so it can be used more efficiently to transport and deliver food orders. You asked your employee, Leslie, to take the van home at night in case she needs to respond to an emergency at the restaurant, such as an after hour alarm or to fill in on busy nights. You advised Leslie that she is not allowed to use the van for any other personal use. Leslie's employment duties do not include delivering food orders, even on a busy night.</p>
<p>In this situation, the CRA's administrative policy does not apply because Leslie does not need the van to perform her employment duties.</p>

<p><strong>Point of call</strong></p>
<p>An exception occurs when the employer requires the employee to proceed directly from home to a point of call other than the employer's place of business to which the employee reports regularly, or to return home from such a point. In other words, these trips are not considered to be of a personal nature.</p>
<h3 id="h_0_1">Example 1</h3>
<p>The employer requires that the employee:</p>

<ul>
<li>travel first thing in the morning directly to a business meeting held at a client's office </li>
<li>go directly from home to a customer's premises to make repairs </li>
<li>return home from a point of call where the employee visited the clients </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_0_2">Example 2</h3>
<p>The employer infrequently and irregularly provides a vehicle that the employee brings home on the day before the specified business travel, and the following morning (or vice-versa), the employee proceeds from home to:</p>

<ul>
<li>a meeting with an out-of town client </li>
<li>a training course (other than the place of business) </li>
<li>a conference (other than the place of business) </li>
</ul>
<p>Another exception occurs when privately-owned motor vehicles are prohibited from entering a restricted area where the employment duties are performed, and when the distances to be travelled within the restricted area are such that a motor vehicle is necessary. The use of the employer's vehicle within the restricted area is not considered to be for personal use.</p>
<p>There is not a personal use component when:</p>

<ul>
<li>an employee is required to work at least three additional hours immediately subsequent to the regular hours of work </li>
<li>the occurrence of such overtime is occasional </li>
<li>public transportation is not available or the physical safety of the employee is at risk at the time of travel </li>
</ul>
<p>Allowances or the value of employer-provided transportation provided to employees for transportation between the employees' residence and special work sites or remote work locations are not taxable. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it91r4.html">Archived Interpretation Bulletin IT91R4, Employment at Special Work Sites or Remote Work Locations</a>.</p>
<p>Employer-provided transportation from pick-up points to a location of employment where, for security or other reasons, public and private vehicles are either not welcome or not practical is not taxable.</p>
<p>In cases where travel includes both a personal element and an employment element, we consider the primary purpose of a particular trip to determine whether it is personal or employment related. It is always a question of fact, and as such, the CRA has not established any specific guidelines or criteria in this regard.</p>
<h2 id="h_1">Regular place of employment</h2>
<p>Determining whether a particular location is a regular place of employment is a question of fact that requires a review of all the relevant facts of each case. Generally, a regular place of employment is any location at which or from which the employee regularly (as a rule) reports for work. For example, if the employee has an office, it is that office; if the employee normally reports to a warehouse, it is that warehouse. The CRA may consider the regularity of the reporting and the nature of the duties when determining whether a location is a regular place of employment.</p>
<p>To summarize, a regular place of employment is a work location where the employee, in connection with their duties, files reports, receives instructions or employment information, or performs other employment related duties. In some cases, a regular place of employment can be an office in the home.</p>
<h2 id="h_2">Home offices</h2>
<p>If an employee is required to have an office at home and that is where their employment duties are based, that office would become the individual's regular place of work. Consequently, the travel from their residence to another location (other than the employer's) in connection with the employment duties would be business related and not personal. However, in the following example we considered travel from a home office to be personal in nature.</p>
<h3 id="h_2_1">Example</h3>
<p>The employee's regular place of work is their home office but is required to regularly attend staff and other meetings at the main office. The main office becomes a second regular place of employment because the employee is viewed as having two locations from which they regularly perform the duties of employment:</p>

<ul>
<li>the home office  </li>
<li>the employer's main office </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the travel between the home office and the main office is personal for the employee even if the employee only reports to the main office once a month.</p>
<h2 id="h_3">More than one regular place of work</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may require the employee to report to more than one regular place of employment. The place of employment can change from time to time because of the nature of the employment situation. </p>
<h3 id="h_3_1">Example 1 &ndash; Regular place of employment</h3>
<p>Company XYZ employs you as a district manager and are responsible for visiting retail stores within the region and must also report once a week to the head office store where you have an office. The company provides you with a vehicle to travel between your residence and the various stores within the region, including the head office store. The CRA determined that each store, including the home store, was a regular place of employment. Consequently, all driving between any of the stores and your home was personal.</p>
<h3 id="h_3_2">Example 2 &ndash; Regular place of employment</h3>
<p>Construction tradesmen traveled from their homes directly to a job site (the employer did not have site offices or trailers at the job sites), between job sites during the course of the workday, and home from another job site at the end of the day. It was determined that each job site was the employer's regular place of business and that the CRA would generally consider the travel from home to the job site and from the job site to home as personal travel. However, travel between job sites during the course of the workday would be business related.</p>
<h3 id="h_3_3">Example 3 &ndash; Travelling is not personal</h3>
<p>The forestry workers reported to a forest camp where they received instructions, prepared reports, and also reported to various cutting sites. The CRA determined that the forest camp set up by the employer was a place of business of the employer and that, in most cases, a forest worker reported regularly to this forest camp. However, the CRA determined that certain cutting sites may not be considered to be regular work sites provided that the forestry worker reported to different cutting sites every week or every two weeks and did not return to the same cutting site for the remainder of the season.</p>
<h3 id="h_3_4">Example 4 - Travel could be either business-related or personal</h3>
<p>The workers travelled from home to different field locations to undertake duties such as meter readings. It was determined that if the workers travelled from home to various customers' locations to read the meters, the first and last trip (from and to home) would be considered to be business travel as well as all trips in-between.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the travel was to read the employer's meters in various locations, perhaps every week or so, the locations would likely be regular places of employment and as such, the first and last trip (from and to home) would be personal travel.</p>
<p>In the first situation, the travel is not considered to be personal given that the various customer locations are not regular places of employment, whereas the travel in the second scenario is considered personal because it is travel to a regular place of employment even though it is only done periodically.</p>
<h2 id="h_4">Logbooks</h2>
<p>Employers, employees, and shareholders are required to keep sufficient records to determine the business and personal use amounts of the total kilometres driven in a calendar year by an employee or a person related to the employee. A logbook or daily record of kilometres travelled for business and non-business use is generally sufficient for this purpose. The logbook should also contain the date, the destination and purpose, name and address of the client, and the distance travelled for each trip. It is ultimately the responsibility of the employee to keep adequate logbooks to justify the business portion of the travel.</p>
