<h2 id="h_1">Determine if a benefit is taxable</h2>
<p>Generally, if you provide a loan and it is considered received because of employment or considered received because of shareholdings, the <strong>interest</strong> benefit is taxable to the employee. </p>
<p>Forgiven loans you provide to your employees are <strong>always</strong> taxable.</p>
<p>Payroll advances you provide to your employees are generally not considered to be an employer provided loan.</p>
<details><summary>What is "considered received because of employment"</summary>
<div id="ajax-employment">
 <p>A loan is considered received because of employment if it is reasonable to conclude that the loan would not have been received, or the terms of the loan would have been different, had there been no current, previous, or intended employment.</p>
 </div>
</details>
<details><summary>What is "considered received because of shareholdings"</summary>
<div id="ajax-shareholdings">
 
<p>If the loans were received or debts were incurred because of shareholdings, the benefit is taxable if <strong>all 3</strong>  of the following apply:</p>
<ol class="lst-stps">
  <li>
 The loan is received, or the debt is incurred, by a person or partnership (except when the person is a corporation resident in Canada or the partnership is one in which each partner is a corporation resident in Canada)</li>
<li>  The person or partnership is <strong>one</strong> of the following:
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">

  <li class="cnjnctn-col">A shareholder of a corporation</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Connected with a shareholder of a corporation</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">A member of a partnership or beneficiary of a trust that was a shareholder of a corporation</li></ul></li>
<li>Because of these shareholdings, the person or partnership receives a loan from, or incurs a debt to <strong>one</strong> of the following:
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <p>The corporation</p>
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <p>A corporation related to that corporation</p>
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <p>A partnership of which the corporation or the related corporation was a member</p>
  </li>
</ul></li>


 
</ol><p>A <strong>person</strong> may be an individual, a corporation, or a trust.</p>

</div>
</details>
<details><summary>What are "forgiven loans"</summary>
  <div id="ajax-forgivable">
<p> Forgiven shareholder loans are taxable as income to the shareholder. Where a person is both a shareholder and an employee, it would be a question of fact whether the indebtedness arose as a result of the person's shareholdings or as a result of the office or employment.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md">Depending on your situation, the interest benefit may not be taxable under the <a href="#adminpolicy" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">CRA's administrative policy&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>.</p>
<h3>Situations</h3>		 
<details><summary>Situation:  Loans received because of employment (previous, current or future)  <span class="label label-warning">New CRA administrative policy</span></summary>

 <h3>Types of loans</h3>
  <details>
 <summary>Loans you provide that are equivalent to an anticipated workers' compensation award</summary>

 <p>To determine if the benefit is taxable on advances or loans made to an employee that are equivalent to an anticipated workers' compensation award, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/special-payments/workers-compensation-claims.html">Workers' compensation claims.</a></p>

 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Loans provided related to your employee's home purchase</summary>
 <div id="ajax-purchase">
 <p>A home-purchase loan is any part of a loan to an employee that the employee used to get or repay another loan to buy a residence. The residence has to be for that employee or a person related to that employee. This also applies to a shareholder or a person related to a shareholder.</p>
 </div>
 </details>
 <details>
 <summary>Loans provided related to your employee's home relocation</summary>
 <div id="ajax-relocation">
<p>Only a debt that is a loan can be a home relocation loan. A home-relocation loan is a loan you give to an employee or an employee's spouse or common-law partner when they meet <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee or your employee's spouse or common-law partner moves to start work at a new location in Canada</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> Your employee or your employee's spouse or common-law partner uses the loan to buy a new residence that is at least 40 kilometres closer to the new work location than the previous home</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> Your employee or your employee's spouse or common-law partner receives the loan because of the employee's employment</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> Your employee designates the loan as a home-relocation loan</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> The loan is used to acquire a residence or a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation acquired only to obtain the right to inhabit a residence owned by the corporation. The residence must be for the habitation of the employee and be their new residence</li>
</ul>
 </details>
 
 <h3>Non-taxable situation</h3>
 <p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if the loan is considered received because of employment, the <strong>interest benefit is not</strong> taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Total amount of the loans received in the year are <strong>equal to or less than $10,000 per year</strong> (includes loans of different term lenghts and principal amounts)</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Term of the loans are <strong>equal to or less than 60 days</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If the term of the loan spans two tax years, the loan will count as part of the $10,000 limit for the year in which the loan was received.</p>

<h3>Taxable situation</h3>
<p>If the loan <strong>does not meet the conditions above</strong>, the <strong>interest benefit</strong> is taxable.</p>

<p>If the <strong>full principal</strong> of the loans is <strong>not repaid within 60 days</strong>, the interest benefit is taxable. You will need to report this amount on a T4 slip in the year it is received.</p>

<p>To calculate the benefit, refer to: <a href="#h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</a></p> 
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Payroll advances you provide related to employment</summary>
<p><strong>Advances are considered to be employment income. You need to deduct CPP, EI and income tax on these amounts you pay your employees.</strong></p>
<p>If you make a payroll advance to your employee on account of their future earnings, the advance is generally not considered to be an employer provided loan for the purposes of 80.4(1) of the Income Tax Act. </p>
<p>These advances are payments for wages, salary and commissions expected to be earned in the course of the employment with you at a future date.</p>
<p>These advances are ordinarily expected to be repaid with employment earnings as long as the employee remains employed by you. The nature of the payment is not changed by your having a right to recover the advance should the employee leave the employment before having earned the full amount advanced to them. </p>
</details>

<details>
<p><summary>Situation:  Loans received because of shareholding <span class="label label-warning">New CRA administrative policy</span></summary>

<h3>Non-taxable situation</h3>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if the loan is considered received because of shareholdings, the <strong>interest benefit is not</strong> taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>

<p>If the term of the loan spans two tax years, the loan will count as part of the $10,000 limit for the year in which the loan was received.</p>
	
<h3>Taxable situation</h3>
<p>If the loan <strong>does not meet the condition above</strong>, the <strong>interest benefit</strong> is taxable.</p>
<p>If the <strong>full principale</strong> of the loans is <strong>not repaid within 60 days</strong>, the interest benefit is taxable. You will need to report this amount on a T4A slip in the year it is received.</p>
<p>To calculate the benefit, refer to: <a href="#h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</a></p> 
</details>



<details><summary>Situation: Loans or debts that are forgiven </summary>

<p>The CRA's administrative policy does not apply if you forgive your employee's loan or debt. The amount forgiven is <strong>always</strong> taxable. </p>

<h4>Forgivable loans</h4>
<p>Forgivable loans are types of loans that allow borrowers to have the balance of the loan partially or totally forgiven if they meet certain conditions.</p>

<p>Forgivable loans received because of shareholdings and a subsequent forgiveness is not considered to be employment income even though the shareholder is also an employee at the time it was forgiven. Instead the forgiven amount is considered as income received by the person in their capacity as a shareholder. </p>
<h3>Forgivable loans specific to pursuing education or research</h3>
<p>If you provide an employee with a forgivable loan to enable them to pursue education or research on condition that they return to employment with you, the income is not to be included in their taxable income at the time they receive it. When the loan (or part of the loan) is later forgiven for the reason that the employment conditions were met, the forgiven part would be included as employment income in the year it was forgiven.</p>
<p>Forgivable loans <strong>do not</strong> include scholarships, fellowships, bursaries or research grants.</p>
<p>For the forgivable loan policy to apply, the amount must be a bone fide loan, repayable if certain conditions are not met.</p>

<h2 id="h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</h2>
<p><strong>If the benefit is taxable</strong>, the calculation of the benefit will depend on type of loan or debt received. You must use the correct <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rates</a> for each quarter. There are multiple different rates for each quarter.</p>

<h4>When to include the benefit on the T4 or T4A slip</h4>
<p>The loan does not need to be outstanding at the borrower's tax year-end for a benefit to be calculated. </p>
<details><summary>If the employee makes a payment during the period</summary>
<p>If the employee makes a payment during the period then two separate calculations are required for the period. Each calculation is based on the declining balance of the loan as payments are made.</p></details>
<details><summary>If the loan is partially or fully forgiven</summary>
<p>If the loan is partially or fully forgiven, the amount forgiven is employment income in the hands of the employee <strong>in the year the loan is forgiven</strong>. There may also be an interest benefit in prior years and up to the date the loan is forgiven.</p></details>
<details><summary>If the loan is considered a repayable award</summary>
<p>If the loan is considered a repayable award, the amount is employment income and must be included on the slip <strong>in the year received</strong>.</p></details>
<h4>What to do with combined loans with low-interest and higher prescribed interest rates</h4>
<p>If you provide two loans to your employee, one at low interest and the other at a rate higher than the prescribed interest rate, combine the loans to calculate the benefit.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Exception:</strong> The amount of interest calculated as a taxable benefit should not be more than the interest that would have been charged at the prescribed rate in effect when the employee made the loan or incurred the debt</li>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> If it is a home purchase loan, the prescribed rate is set as a ceiling at the time the loan is granted, but may decrease if the prevailing prescribed rate falls</li>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> If the term of repayment for the loan is more than five years, the balance owing at the end of five years (from the day the loan was made) is considered a new loan. Treat the outstanding balance as a new loan on that date.</li></ul>
 
		 <details>
			 <summary>Examples: Home purchase loans or home relocation loans</summary>
<ul>			
<li>January 1, 20X1, an employee borrows $100,000 from their employer.</li>
<li>Loan is repayable in 25 years. The term is 3 years with an interest rate of 2%.</li>

<li>Employee made interest payments of $1,000 in 20X1, $2,000 in 20X2 and $1,500 in 20X3.</li>
<li>Employee made a payment on principal balance of $10,000 on January 1, 20X3.</li>
<li>January 1, 20X4, the loan is renewed for another three year term with an interest rate of 2%. </li>
<li>Prescribed interest rates for 20X4 is 3%, 20X5 is 4% and 20X6 4%.</li>
<li>Employee made interest payments of $1,500 in 20X4, $1,500 in 20X5 and $1,500 in 20X6.</li>
