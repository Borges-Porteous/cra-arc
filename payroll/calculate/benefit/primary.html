<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Guidance on who is the primary beneficiary of an expenditure</h1>

 
<p>You may provide your employees with benefits (directly or indirectly), in the form of cash, goods, services, allowances, or reimbursements. The following will help you determine who the primary beneficiary of the benefit is: the employer or the employee. </p>

 <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
  	
<ul>
<li><a href="#h_1">Factors to consider </a></li>
<li><a href="#h_3">What if you do not know who is the primary beneficiary</a></li>
</ul>

 <h2 id="h_1">Factors to consider</h2>
<ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">
        
  <li> <h3> Benefit </h3>
<p>Is the benefit something that can be used on an ongoing basis or something that can only be used once? </p>
	  <ul>
<li>Ongoing </li>
<li>Once </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally,  </p>
</li>

<li><h3> Recipient </h3>
<ol class="lst-stps-sub">
<li><p>Who received the benefit? </p>
	<ul>
<li>Employee </li>
<li>Employee's family member or friend </li>
</ul>
	<p>Generally,  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Was the benefit available to other employees with different duties? </p>
	<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally,  </p>	
</li>
</ol>

<li><h3> Use in employment </h3>
<ol class="lst-stps-sub">
<li></li>

</ol>

<li><h3>Personal use </h3>
<ol class="lst-stps-sub">
<li><p>Did the employer place restrictions on the use of the benefit? </p>
<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, when the employer places restrictions on the use of the benefit it may mean that the employer is trying to contain the use to that which is beneficial to the employer. Depending on the situation, it may mean that the employer is the primary beneficiary. This includes restrictions on where and how the benefit can be used. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Did the nature of the benefit significantly limit the opportunity for personal use?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, the employer is the primary beneficiary if the benefit provides limited opportunity for personal use. This could be considered as provided for business use. </p>	
</li>

<li><p>Was there in fact any personal use of the benefit? </p>
<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, the employee is the primary beneficiary if the employee enjoyed personal use of the benefit. This includes situations were restrictions on the ability of the employee to use the benefit for personal use even if those restrictions are placed by the employer.</p>

	<td>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing </li>
<li>Once </li>
</ul>
</td>
	<td>If the benefit is a situation that is continuing, for example, the use of a parking space, answer ongoing. If the benefit is a situation that it is used completely, for example a airplane ticket or a meal, answer once. </td>

	<td class="align-right">2 - Recipient</td>
	<td>Who received the benefit? </td>
	<td>
<ul>
<li>Employee </li>
<li>Employee's family member or friend </li>
</ul>
</td>
	<td>This question focuses on the direct recipient of the benefit. If multiple parties received the benefit, run the classifier for each recipient.
<br />
This does not include mere use of a benefit given to the employee but refers to a benefit given to the family member or friend independently. Family members include spouses, children, siblings, parents, cousins, uncles, aunts, and grandparents. It is unlikely that a non-employee relative or friend would use the benefit in a way that would help or benefit the employer. As such, in situations where the benefit goes to a family member or friend it is less likely that the primary beneficiary is the employer. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="align-right">3 - Recipient</td>
	<td>Was the benefit available to other employees with different duties? </td>
	<td>
<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>
</td>
	<td>Generally, the employee is the primary beneficiary if the benefit is given to other employees with different duties. This could mean that the benefit was not tied to the employee's specific employment duties. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="align-right">4 - Use in employment</td>
	<td>Did the employee's work productivity improve because of the benefit? </td>
	<td>
<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>
</td>
	<td>Whether a benefit improves the employee's work productivity depends in part on the employee's particular role and responsibilities.
<br />
For example, the use of a truck outfitted with specialized natural gas utility equipment improves the effectiveness of an employee responsible for responding to natural gas service calls, but not an employee who only has an office role.
<br />
Attendance at an out-of-town sales conference can improve the skills of a salesperson employee, but not the employee's spouse unless the spouse is also involved in sales work for the employer.
<br />
A parking pass can improve the efficiency of an employee who is required to visit clients and return to the office throughout the day, but not an employee who has no such duties and for whom a parking pass is only a convenience. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="align-right">5 - Use in employment</td>
	<td>Would it be possible for the employee to do his or her job without the benefit or a replacement? </td>
	<td>
<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>
</td>
	<td>Consider whether the employee could have fulfilled his or her role without the benefit. In situations where the role could theoretically have been done without the benefit but it would be so inefficient that it would not be commercially viable, answer "No."
<br />
Since the employer benefits from the job duties being fulfilled when that would not be possible without the benefit it suggests the employer is the primary beneficiary. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="align-right">6 - Use in employment</td>
	<td>Is it usual for employers in this industry to provide this benefit to employees to allow those employees to more effectively perform the duties of employment? </td>
	<td>
<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>
</td>
	<td>This question asks whether the benefit conferred on the taxpayer is typical for other employees in the industry.
<br />
For example, if a taxpayer who works for a limousine company is typically provided with a car, answer "Yes."
<br />
If a computer engineer working for a software company is not typically provided with a car, answer "No."
<br />
When it is common in the industry to provide the benefit to allow employees to more effectively perform their duties, it suggests the employer is the primary beneficiary. This is especially true when the benefit actually enhances productivity or makes it possible for the employee to do his or her job. </td>
