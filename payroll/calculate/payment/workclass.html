<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Content has been developed to provide guidance only and it does not replace the law. <strong>No changes were made to the existing legislative requirement. </strong></p>

 <h2 id="h_0">Why do you need to determine if a worker is an employee or is a self-employed individual</h2>
<p>It is important to decide whether a worker is an <strong>employee </strong>or a <strong>self-employed individual</strong>. Employment status directly affects a person's entitlement to employment insurance (EI) benefits under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-5.6/index.html">Employment Insurance Act</a>. It can also have an impact on how a worker is treated under other legislation such as the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-8/index.html">Canada Pension Plan</a> and the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html">Income Tax Act</a>.</p>
<p>The facts of the working relationship as a whole decide the employment status.</p>
<p>Learn more about CPP, EI and income tax deductions: <a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/when/index.html">Get ready to make deductions</a></p>

 <h2 id="h_1">Factors to consider</h2>
<p>You need to consider multiple factors to determine if the worker is an employee or self-employed. </p>

<details><summary>What is considered an employee or a self-employed (independent contractor)</summary>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12">
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Employee</dt> <dd> A person who works in the service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance. </dd>
<dt>Self-employed worker (independent contractor)</dt><dd> One who is hired to undertake a specific project but who is left free to do the assigned work and to choose the method for accomplishing it. Unlike an employee, an independent contractor who commits a wrong while carrying out the work does not create liability for the one who did the hiring.</dd>

<ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">
        
<li> <h3 id="1"> Contract arrangement </h3>
<p>The CRA asks the worker and the payer what their intent was when they entered into the working arrangement. Workers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs. However, the employment status they choose must reflect their working relationship.</p>
<details><summary>Terms and conditions of employment in an agreement</summary>
<p>Sometimes the intention is clear and both parties are in agreement (common intent). Sometimes the intent can be found in a written agreement. Sometimes the two parties have a different understanding as to the status of their working relationship, in which case there is no common intent.</p>
<p>To decide the parties’ intentions, the CRA gets a copy of the contract, or testimony by the parties and examines the parties’ actions. Both parties’ intentions form part of the context of the employment that the CRA analyses.</p>
<p>Whether or not the service provider must carry out the work personally or if they can hire or subcontract the work (not being able to subcontract relevant work may indicate an employment relationship)</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions</summary>
<li>Are there any contracts involved (collective agreements, individual contracts, etc.)? It is <strong>extremely important for the CPP/EI Officer to obtain copies of all contracts </strong>involved including any appendices or other attachments. </li>

</details>

	 <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 id="1aemployee" class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Employer-employee </h4>
<p>The two parties intend to enter into a contract <strong>of</strong> service (COS)</p>

</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 id="1acontractor" class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Self-employed (indipendent contractor) </h4>
<p>The two parties intend to enter into a contract <strong>for</strong> services</p> (CFS)

</li>
</ul>


</li>

<li><h3 id="2">Control </h3>
<p>Control is the ability, authority, or right of a payer to exercise control over a worker concerning the manner in which the work is done and what work will be done.</p>
<details><summary>Degree of control or independence</summary>
<p>Consider the degree of control held by the payer or the degree of independence held by the worker.</p>
<p>The actual degree of control will vary with the type of work and the skills of the worker.</p>
<p>Deciding the degree of control can be difficult when examining the employment of professionals such as engineers, doctors, and IT consultants. Because of their expertise and specialized training, they may need little or no specific direction in their daily activities. When examining the factor of control, it is necessary to focus on both the payer's control over the worker's daily activities and the payer's influence over the worker.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Payer's right to exercise control</summary>
<p>It is the right of the payer to exercise control that is relevant, <strong>not </strong>whether the payer actually exercises this right.</p>
<p>It is the control of a payer over a worker that is relevant and <strong>not </strong>the control of a payer over the end result of a product or service purchased.</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions</summary>
<ul>
<li>Who determines how the worker will do the work?
<ul>
<li>Ask the worker to describe a typical day's work with the payer. Ask the worker to provide details regarding how the day unfolds. Get a complete, in-depth description of the work done by the worker. A good understanding of the work to be accomplished and the payer's expectations as to the role of the worker will help determine to what extent the payer maintains the right to control the worker and whether the payer actually exercises that right. </li>
<li>Does the worker possess technical expertise, professional qualifications or specialized skills essential for this role? </li>
<li>Who determines what work the worker is to perform? </li>
<li>Is the worker told what tools, equipment, and supplies to use? </li>
<li>Who establishes priorities and deadlines? </li>
<li>Does the payer direct the worker? Are written or oral directions/instructions and/or training given to the worker? Is the worker required to secure prior approval before taking certain actions? </li>
<li>Does the worker give any input with regard to how the work is done? Who has the final word? </li>
<li>Can the payer exercise any disciplinary actions? </li>
<li>Who determines the amount of pay? Is the amount negotiated between the worker and the payer? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can the worker accept other contracts? Are there any restrictions put upon the worker by the payer with respect to working for others? </li>
<li>Does the worker have the ability to accept and refuse work from the payer? Are there any consequences should the worker refuse work? </li>
<li>Is the relationship between the worker and the payer a relationship of subordination or more of collaboration? </li>
<li>Were some of the terms and conditions of employment negotiated? </li>
<li>Is the worker represented on the job by a union, and are the terms and conditions of employment governed by a collective agreement? </li>
</ul>
</details>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 id="2_1" class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Indicators that the worker is an employee</h4>
<ul>
<li>The relationship is one of subordination. The payer will often direct, scrutinize, and effectively control many elements of how and when the work is carried out </li>
<li>The payer controls the worker with respect to both the results of the work and the method used to do the work </li>
<li>The payer chooses and controls the method and amount of pay. Salary negotiations may still take place in an employer-employee relationship </li>
<li>The payer decides what jobs the worker will do </li>
<li>The payer chooses to listen to the worker's suggestions but has the final word </li>
<li>The worker requires permission to work for other payers while working for this payer </li>
<li>Where the schedule is irregular, priority on the worker's time is an indication of control over the worker </li>
<li>The worker receives training or direction from the payer on how to do the work. The overall work environment between the worker and the payer is one of subordination </li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 id="2_2" class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Indicators that the worker is self-employed</h4>
<ul>
<li>A self-employed individual usually works independently </li>
<li>The worker does not have anyone overseeing their activities </li>
<li>The worker is usually free to work when and for whom they choose and may provide their services to different payers at the same time </li>
<li>The worker can accept or refuse work from the payer </li>
<li>The working relationship between the payer and the worker does <strong>not </strong>present a degree of continuity, loyalty, security, subordination, or integration, all of which are generally associated with an employer-employee relationship </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><h3 id="3"> Ownership of the tools and equipment</h3>
<p>Consider if the worker owns and provides tools and equipment to accomplish the work. Contractual control of, and responsibility for, an asset in a rental or lease situation is also considered under this factor.</p>	
<details><summary>What is considered a significant investment</summary>
<p>What is relevant is the significant investment in the tools and equipment along with the cost of replacement, repair, and insurance. A worker who has made a significant investment is likely to retain a right over the use of these assets, diminishing the payer's control over how the work is carried out. In addition, such a significant investment may place the worker at a risk of a financial loss.</p>
<p>Tools and equipment can vary widely in terms of value and can include everything from wrenches and hammers, to specialized clothing, appliances, stethoscopes, musical instruments, computers, and vehicles such as trucks and tractors.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals often supply the tools and equipment required for a contract. As a result, the ownership of tools and equipment by a worker is more commonly associated with a business relationship.</p>
<p>However, employees sometimes also have to provide their own tools. The courts have acknowledged that because a worker is required to provide tools of the trade, this does not in itself mean that the worker is a self-employed individual. For example, many skilled tradespeople such as auto mechanics have to supply their own tools, even if they are full-time employees.</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions</summary>
<ul>
<li>What tools and equipment are required for the worker to perform the work? </li>
<li>Who provides the tools and equipment required by the worker to perform their work? </li>
<li>What is the estimated total value of the tools &amp; equipment provided by the worker? By the payer? </li>
<li>If the payer provides the tools and equipment, is the worker charged any fee for their usage? </li>
<li>Who pays for the repairs and maintenance of the required tools and equipment? </li>
</ul>

<li>The worker supplies their own workspace, is responsible for the costs to maintain it, and does substantial work from that site </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3 id="4"> Subcontracting work or hiring assistants</h3>
<p>Consider if the worker can subcontract work or hire assistants. This factor can help decide a worker's business presence because subcontracting work or hiring assistants can affect their chance of profit and risk of loss.</p>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions</summary>
<ul>
<li>Can the worker hire a substitute? Can the worker choose the substitute? </li>
<li>Can the worker hire helpers to help in accomplishing their tasks? Can the worker choose their helpers? </li>
<li>Who bears the cost of paying the helper/substitute's salary and/or any benefits? </li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><h3 id="5">Financial risk</h3>
<p>Consider the degree of financial risk taken by the worker. Consider if there are any fixed ongoing costs incurred by the worker or any expenses that are not reimbursed.</p>
<details><summary>Employees will usually not have financial risks</summary>
<p>Usually, employees will not have any financial risk as any expenses will be reimbursed, and they will not have fixed ongoing costs.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals, on the other hand, can have financial risk and incur losses because they usually pay fixed monthly costs even if work is not currently being done.</p>
<p>Employees and self-employed individuals may be reimbursed for business or travel expenses. Therefore, focus on the expenses that are <strong>not </strong>reimbursed by the payer.</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions</summary>
<ul>
<li>It is extremely important to ask what expenses are incurred by the worker in the performance of services for the payer. </li>
<li>Does the payer reimburse the worker for any expenses? If yes, specify the reimbursed expenses. Are these expenses reimbursed as part of negotiated benefits? </li>
<li>Does the worker have copies of any financial statements showing expenses related to their work? If so, obtain a copy. </li>
<li>Who covers the cost for travel expenses, benefits, vacation pay, and certain leaves? </li>
<li>Does the worker have any expenses that could be so substantial as to incur a business loss? </li>
<li>Does the worker have any expenses pertaining to the running of a business, such as rent, advertising, business telephone, overhead, etc.? </li>
<li>How is the remuneration calculated? What does it include? Is the remuneration based on seniority? Is it based by the hour or by a lump sum, etc.? </li>
<li>Is the worker liable for any expenses if they cannot perform the work? </li>
<li>Can the worker look for work with other payers? </li>
<li>Can the worker hire any helpers or assistants to do some portions of their work? Do they? Who pays the helpers? If the worker hires the helpers, is the payer's approval necessary? </li>
<li>Can the worker be liable for negligence or for inappropriate actions in the course of their work? </li>
<li>Can the payer discharge the worker at any time without incurring a liability? </li>
<li>Can the worker terminate the services at any time without incurring a liability? Is the worker entitled to terminate the services at any time? Can they be liable for damages? </li>

<li><h3 id="6">Responsibility for investment and management</h3>
<p>Consider the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker. A significant investment is evidence that a business relationship may exist. You should also consider if the worker is free to make business decisions that affect their profit or loss.</p>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions</summary>
<ul>
<li>What capital investment does the worker have? </li>
<li>Does the worker maintain a workspace? </li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3 id="7">Opportunity for profit</h3>
<p>Consider whether the worker can realize a profit or incur a loss, as this indicates that a worker controls the business aspects of services rendered and that a business relationship likely exists. To have a chance of a profit and a risk of a loss, a worker has to have potential proceeds and expenses, and one could exceed the other.</p>
<details><summary>Consider this factor from the worker's perspective</summary>
<p>This factor has to be considered from the worker's perspective, not the payer's. It is for the most part an assessment of the degree to which the worker can control their proceeds and expenses.</p>
<p>Employees normally do not have the chance of a profit and risk of a loss even though their remuneration can vary depending on the terms of their employment contracts. For example, employees working on a commission or piece-rate basis, or employees with a productivity bonus clause in their contract can increase their earnings based on their productivity. This increase in income is not normally viewed as a profit, as it is not the excess of proceeds over expenses.</p>
<p>Employees may have expenses directly related to their employment, such as automobile expenses, and board and lodging costs. Normally, expenses would not place employees at risk of incurring a loss because it is unlikely that the expenses would be greater than their remuneration.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals normally have the chance of profit or risk of loss, because they have the ability to pursue and accept contracts as they see fit. They can negotiate the price (or unilaterally set their prices) for their services and have the right to offer those services to more than one payer. Self-employed individuals will normally incur expenses to carry out the terms and conditions of their contracts, and to manage those expenses to maximize net earnings. Self-employed individuals can increase their proceeds and/or decrease their expenses in an effort to increase profit.</p>
<p>Employees generally do not share in profits or suffer losses incurred by the payer's business.</p>
<p>The method of payment may help to decide if the worker has the opportunity to make a profit or incur a loss. In an employer-employee relationship, the worker is normally guaranteed a return for the work done and is usually paid on an hourly, daily, weekly, or similar basis.</p>
<p>Similarly, some self-employed individuals are paid on an hourly basis. However, when a worker is paid a flat rate for the work done, it generally indicates a business relationship, especially if the worker incurs expenses in doing the work.</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions</summary>
<ul>
<li>Is the worker able to hire another person to perform the work at a lesser rate, thereby gaining a profit from the difference? </li>
<li>Can the worker negotiate with the payer in order to obtain a higher payment or additional benefits? Does the worker have the ability to negotiate the terms of a contract? </li>
<li>Is there a guarantee of work? Is there a guaranteed minimum pay or fringe benefits? Are there any paid leaves? </li>
<li>What are the terms or schedule of payments? </li>
<li>How is the remuneration determined? Is it negotiated with each employment contract or by collective agreements, etc.? </li>
<li>Is the worker responsible for liabilities resulting from the employment contract (i.e. health and safety issues and third party liability)? </li>
