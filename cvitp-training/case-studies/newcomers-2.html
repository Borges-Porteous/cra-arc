<p>Steps to follow</p>
<ol>
  <li>Review their background information and required  slips</li>
  <li>In <strong>Spouse  interview type</strong>, select <strong>Net income  only</strong> from the <strong>What information will  you provide for your spouse?</strong> drop-down menu</li>
  <li>In <strong>Spouse  – basic information</strong>, enter <strong>$2,800</strong> into the <strong>Net federal income of your spouse (line 23600 of his or her return) OR  net world income in Canadian dollars, if your spouse is a non-resident of  Canada</strong> field and select <strong>No</strong> from  the <strong>Did your spouse receive universal  child care benefits in 2022? </strong>drop-down  menu</li>
  <li>In <strong>CRA  questions</strong>, select <strong>Yes</strong> from the <strong>Are you filing an income tax return with  the CRA for the very fist time? </strong>drop-down  menu and <strong>No</strong> from the <strong>Do you have Canadian citizenship? </strong>drop-down menu<strong></strong></li>
  <li>In <strong>Interview setup</strong>, tick the boxes next to:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immigrant, emigrant, non-resident  taxpayer, you are a Canadian resident and your spouse immigrated to Canada in  the year</strong> in the <strong>Specific situations</strong> section</li>
      <li><strong>Employment income and employment  insurance benefits (T4, T4E/RL-6)</strong> and <strong>Social assistance, worker&rsquo;s  compensation (T5007/RL-5)</strong> in the <strong>Employment  and other benefits</strong> section</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On the <strong>Immigrant,  emigrant or non-resident </strong>page, click the <strong>+</strong> sign next to <strong>You  immigrated to Canada in 2022</strong> to enter Martin&rsquo;s <strong>Date of entry</strong></li>
  <li>Under  the<strong> Canadian sourced income  (excluding Part XIII income) earned when you were not a resident of Canada </strong>heading, select <strong>Source of income</strong> from the <strong>Income  from employment in Canada</strong> drop-down menu and enter the amount of <strong>$0.00</strong> into the field<strong></strong></li>
  <li>Under  the <strong>Canadian source Part XIII  income PLUS foreign sourced income earned when you were not a resident of  Canada</strong> heading, enter <strong>France</strong> into the <strong>Name of country</strong> field, select <strong>Net  employment income</strong> from the <strong>foreign source of income </strong>drop-down menu,  and enter the amount of <strong>$5,000 </strong>into the next field<strong></strong></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Social assistance, worker&rsquo;s compensation </strong>in the left-side menu, then  click the <strong>+</strong> sign next to <strong>T5007 </strong>to enter Martin&rsquo;s T5007  information </li>
  <li>After entering Martin&rsquo;s T5007 information,  select <strong>No</strong> from the <strong>Did you live with your spouse or common-law  partner when you received the social assistance benefits? </strong>drop-down menu and select <strong>Original </strong>from the <strong>Is this an amended slip? </strong>drop-down  menu</li>
</ol>
<p>Since Simonne still lives in France, she does not need to complete  a Canadian tax return so only her net income is needed on Martin&rsquo;s tax return.</p>
<p> Income earned prior to immigration is not reported in the  solution because it is only used to calculate benefit and credit eligibility.</p>
<p> Martin&rsquo;s basic personal amount and spouse or common-law  partner amount are reduced. These  amounts are prorated by the tax software based on the amount of time he has  been in Canada.</p>
