<h3>Takeaway points</h3>

<p>Steps to follow</p>
<ol>
  <li>Review their background information,  the required slips and medical receipts</li>
  <li>Verify the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/canadasite/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/lines-33099-33199-eligible-medical-expenses-you-claim-on-your-tax-return/details-medical-expenses.html">Details of medical expenses</a> on  Canada.ca </li>
  <li>Enter the eligible medical expenses  in the profile of the person who incurred them</li>
  <li>For Michael and Elizabeth, in the <strong>Interview  setup, </strong>check the box next to <strong>Medical expenses, disability, caregiver </strong>in  the <strong>Common tax deductions </strong>section</li>
  <li>For Jack and Adam, click <strong>Medical  and disability </strong>in the left side menu</li>
  <li>It is not necessary to enter each  medical receipt individually; enter <strong>See  list </strong>in the description and  indicate the total amount of eligible medical expenses</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, although amounts paid for vitamins are  generally not eligible medical expenses, vitamin B12, when prescribed by a  health care professional, is considered eligible.</p>
<p> Individuals can claim eligible medical expenses paid in any  12-month period ending in the year the individual is filing their return for.  As such, in this scenario, the medical receipts paid in December of 2021 can be  claimed on the 2022 return since they were not previously claimed.</p>
<p> The eligible medical expenses claimed  must be reduced by any amount that has been reimbursed.</p>
<p> UFile has determined it is more  beneficial to claim all the medical expenses for the family in Michael&rsquo;s tax  return. Michael is eligible to claim the medical expenses paid for Adam, since  Adam is his spouse's father and is dependent on them for support, even though  he does not live with them.</p>
<p> Because Michael earns a modest  working income, and is claiming a large amount of medical expenses for his  family, he is eligible for the refundable medical expense supplement (line  45200). UFile will automatically calculate and claim the amount on line 45200.</p>

<p>For more information  refer to <a href="../tax-guide/info/other-topics-ff.html">UFile instructions</a>.</p>
