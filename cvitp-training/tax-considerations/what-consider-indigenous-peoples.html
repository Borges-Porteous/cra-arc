      <h2 id="h1">Status Indian definition</h2>
      <p>Many First Nations people in  Canada prefer not to be referred to as <strong>Indians</strong>. However, for&nbsp;purposes of the tax  exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, the CRA uses the term Indian  because it has a legal meaning in the Indian Act. Individuals who are Indians,  as defined in the Indian Act, are often referred to as Status Indians.</p>
      <p> Generally, a Status Indian is subject to the same tax  rules as other Canadian residents&nbsp;unless their income is eligible for tax  exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act. If a Status Indian's personal  property, including income, is earned or situated on a reserve&nbsp; then it is exempt from tax. This may  include employment income earned by a Status Indian who does not live on a  reserve, but who performs their duties of employment on a reserve.</p>
      <p> For more information, refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/indigenous-peoples/indian-act-exemption-employment-income-guidelines.html" target="_blank">Indian  Act Exemption for Employment Income Guidelines</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="h5 mrgn-tp-sm">Important note</h3>
  <p>As a&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;volunteer, you are  not required to determine an individual's status or income exemption.</p>
</div>
</section>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
      <h2 id="h2">Employment-related  income</h2>
      <p>Generally, if a Status Indian  receives the following types of income, the CRA treats them in the same way as  the employment income that gave rise to the benefit:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Employment       Insurance benefits (EI) </li>
        <li>Canada       Pension Plan benefits (CPP)</li>
        <li>Quebec       Pension Plan benefits (QPP) </li>
        <li>registered       pension plan benefits</li>
        <li>retiring       allowances</li>
        <li>wage-loss       replacement plan benefits</li>
      </ul>
For  example, if all of the individual&rsquo;s employment income was tax exempt under section  87 of the Indian Act then, all of the EI benefits the individual would be  eligible for, because of their employment income, would also be tax exempt.  However, if only 50% of their employment income was tax exempt then, only 50%  of their EI benefits are tax exempt.
      <h2 id="h3">Exempt  income</h2>
      <p>Certain amounts may not be claimed as  deductions if they are directly related to tax-exempt income. If the income is  only partially exempt, the deduction is granted in the same proportion. For  example, a Status Indian who pays union dues and&nbsp;whose income is only 60%  exempt, would only be able to claim 40% of the union dues as a deduction to  offset the taxable portion of their employment income.</p>
      <p> Oher deductions may include the Registered Pension Plan (RPP) contributions.</p>
      <p> Tax-exempt income is not considered in the calculation of many deductions,  tax credits, and benefits, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Canada child benefit (CCB)</li>
        <li>GST/HST credit</li>
        <li>RRSP deduction limits</li>
        <li>charitable donations</li>
        <li>medical expenses</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="h4">Form T90 Income exempt under the  Indian Act </h2>
      <p>Individuals  who are registered, or eligible to be registered, as a Status Indian under the  Indian Act <strong>and</strong> have income that is tax-exempt under the Indian  Act can use the form T90 to calculate their net exempt income. With this  completed form, the CRA&nbsp;can properly calculate the individual&rsquo;s&nbsp;Canada  training credit limit (CTCL) for the following year, if applicable, and the  Canada workers benefit (CWB) for the current tax year.      </p>

<p> For example, if an individual&rsquo;s <a href="../tax-guide/info/pensions-saving-plans-ff.html">tax exempt income qualifies them for the CWB</a>, &nbsp;that same exempt income  would not affect the calculation of their Canada child benefit (CCB) or  their&nbsp;GST/HST&nbsp;credit. </p>
      <h2 id="h5">Tax slips that do not indicate  exemptions </h2>
      <p>These slips do not indicate if  the stated income is fully or partially exempt from tax, or if it needs to be  included or excluded from an individual&rsquo;s return. It is the individual&rsquo;s  responsibility to inform you of any tax exempt amounts.</p>

      <p>The COVID-19 benefits are taxable the same  way as employment-related income.

If  only 50% of the employment income was tax exempt then the individual&rsquo;s COVID-19  benefits are also only 50% tax exempt. The tax exempt amount is not identified  as such on the slip</p>

      <p> The software automatically generates the&nbsp;Residency information for tax  administration agreements&nbsp;section within the Interview setup whenever one  of the participating provinces or territories of residence is selected. Select  the appropriate response from the drop-down menu to either indicate which  community they resided in on December 31, or that the individual did not reside  on settlement lands or within a designated community. If the individual is  unsure if they reside on the specific lands, ask them to contact their local Band   or you may contact the&nbsp;CVITP dedicated help line at 1-866-398-3488.</p>
