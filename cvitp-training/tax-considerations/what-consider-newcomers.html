<h2 id="h1">Residency status for tax purposes</h2>
<p>There are different types of residency  statuses for tax purposes. As a volunteer, you mainly work with individuals who  are residents or newcomers.</p>
<p> Residents are individuals who live in and have significant residential ties  with Canada. An individual is generally considered a resident, for tax  purposes, from the time they enter Canada. All residents of Canada, including  refugees, may submit a tax return even if they have only been in the country for  a few months.</p>
<p> Newcomers are individuals who left another country to come and live in  Canada. Newcomer status applies only for the&nbsp;first tax year in which they  became a resident, even if they have only been in Canada for a few months.</p>
<p> Once the individual has been a resident for tax purposes for a whole year,  they will then submit a regular tax return. For example, someone who arrived in  Canada in 2021 is considered a newcomer for the 2021 taxation year only. They  would submit a regular tax return for the 2022 taxation year.</p>
<p>An individual&rsquo;s residency status for tax  purposes is important, as it determines whether or not they are required to submit  a tax return in Canada. A person&rsquo;s residency status for tax purposes is  different from their immigration status.</p>

  <h3 class="h5 mrgn-tp-sm">Important note</h3> 
	<p>As a CVITP  volunteer, you are not  responsible for determining a person&rsquo;s residency status or to advise them of  their tax obligations.</p>
</div>
</section>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
	
<p>If an individual is unsure of their residency status, refer them to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html">Determining your residency  status</a> ,&nbsp; the individuals&rsquo;  tax enquiries line or you may contact the CVITP  dedicated line on their behalf.</p>

<h2 id="h2">Date of entry</h2>
<p>The date of entry is the date when the  individual became a resident of Canada for tax purposes and this generally  corresponds to the date the individual arrived in Canada. It is important to  enter the exact date, as this could affect the amount of non-refundable  tax credits    they may be eligible for.</p>
<p> In the following graphic, the date of  entry is August 10, 2022. Based on the date of entry, a newcomer&rsquo;s <strong>first  year</strong> in Canada can be split into <strong>two periods</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when they were a <strong>non-resident</strong> of  Canada (January 1 to August 9, 2022)</li>
  <li>when they were a <strong>resident</strong> of Canada  (August 10 to December 31, 2022)</li>
</ul>

<p>For most newcomers, the income  they earned before they move to Canada is non-taxable. It does not need to be  included in the Total income section of the tax return. However, it is important to  provide this information since this income is required to calculate certain  benefits and credits.</p>

<h2 id="h3">Identification numbers</h2>
<p>One of the most important steps  when you use UFile CVITP&nbsp;to prepare a tax return is the <strong>identification section</strong> of the interview.</p>
<p> Newcomers may have an individual tax  number (ITN) or a temporary tax number (TTN) instead of a social insurance  number (SIN). The ITN or TTN allows newcomers without a SIN to submit their tax  return and apply for benefits.</p>
<p> The ITN is only issued  to non-residents and international students who are not eligible to obtain a  SIN.&nbsp;Residents of Canada who are not eligible to receive a SIN or an ITN  and are required to submit a tax return may be assigned a TTN. A TTN is a  nine-digit number beginning with a zero (01 or 03). This is an internal number  that the CRA provides to the individual.</p>
<p>As a volunteer, you are not expected to provide assistance in filling out  applications for an identification number.</p>
<p> If the individual wants more information about obtaining a SIN, refer them  to Canada.ca <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html" target="_blank">Social  Insurance Number - Overview</a>. </p>

        <th>Social    Insurance Number (SIN)</th>
        <td><p>If the  individual has a SIN or a temporary SIN you may enter either into the SIN field  in the tax software.</p>
          <p> If the individual is waiting to receive their SIN, you may:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>prepare a paper       tax return leaving the SIN field blank and attach a note to the return       explaining that the individual is waiting for their SIN</li>
            <li>use the tax       software to prepare the tax return and enter zeros in the SIN field. You       will need to print the tax return and submit it with a note attached to explain       that the individual is waiting for their SIN.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The tax return is held until Service Canada  issues the individual's&nbsp;SIN.</p>

          <li>If the       individual is an international student without a SIN or an ITN, they       should complete Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1261.html" target="_blank">T1261, Application for a Canada Revenue Agency       Individual Tax Number (ITN) for Non-Residents</a> (even if they are a resident).</li>

          <li>If the       individual does not already have a TTN you must attach a note to the tax       return to request a TTN because the individual is not eligible for a SIN       or an ITN.</li>
          <li>When  a TTN is requested, the CRA contacts the individual to inform them of the  documentation that is required before a TTN may be issued and the tax  return processed.</li>
        </ul>
</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
    <p>For more information on how to print a tax  return, refer to How to review and send the return.</p>
    <p>Refer  to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/where-mail-your-paper-t1-return.html">Where  to mail your paper T1 return</a> for situations where EFILE is not possible. </p>

<h2 id="h5">Information about a newcomer&rsquo;s spouse</h2>
    <p>If the newcomer&rsquo;s spouse or common-law partner lives in Canada with them, proceed  as usual.</p>
    <p> If a newcomer&rsquo;s spouse or  common-law partner is living abroad and they are separated for reasons other than a breakdown in  their relationship, you must still enter a marital status of either married or common-law on their tax return.</p>
    <p> Since a non-resident spouse does  not need to submit a tax return in Canada it is important to report the  spouse&rsquo;s name and their net income in Canadian dollars using the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/annual-average-exchange-rates/">annual  exchange rates</a>. The CRA needs this information to  calculate the benefits and credits for the individual living in Canada.</p>
    <p>If  newcomers provide financial support to their non-resident spouse, they may be eligible  to claim a spousal amount on their tax return. The individual must keep any  supporting documentation or receipts so that, if contacted by the CRA at a  later date, they can prove the non-resident spouse depended on them for  support.</p>

<h2 id="h6">Reporting foreign property over $100,000 (Canadian)</h2>
    <p>An individual  does <strong>not </strong>have to report foreign property for the year they first become  a resident of Canada.</p>
    <p> Foreign property <strong>does not</strong> include any personal use property, such as a primary residence,  vacation home, or cottage.</p>

    <p>The individual is not eligible for the CVITP  if they <strong>own foreign property</strong> and <strong>were a resident of  Canada in any previous year</strong>, and you should <strong>not</strong> prepare the return tax because it would be considered a complex tax situation.</p>

<p> Foreign property owned includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>bank accounts held abroad (interest)</li>
      <li>shares held in foreign corporations&nbsp;or shares held in a resident corporation but held outside of Canada</li>
      <li>vacant land abroad</li>
      <li>other income-earning foreign property</li>
    </ul>  
 
    <p>Remember to always convert all foreign  income into Canadian dollars. The Bank of Canada has <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/annual-average-exchange-rates/" target="_blank">annual  exchange rates</a> available for most countries.</p>

<h2 id="h7">Income earned inside and  outside Canada</h2>
    <p>Newcomers must report any world income they earned while they were a&nbsp;<strong>resident</strong>&nbsp;of  Canada.</p>
    <p> In some instances, an individual may also have earned Canadian-sourced  income while they were a non-resident. They may be asked to report that income  if they wish to apply for the&nbsp;GST/HST&nbsp;tax credit, the Canada child  benefit (CCB) or other credits and benefits for which they  may qualify.</p>

<h2 id="h8">Non-refundable tax credits</h2>
    <p>A newcomer may claim non-refundable  tax credits  that  are proportional to the number of days in the year they were considered to be a  resident of Canada. The amounts that they can claim are calculated based on  their <strong>Date</strong><strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>entry</strong></strong>.</p>
    <p> However, if the newcomer&rsquo;s taxable income in Canada represents 90% or more  of their world income then the 90% rule allows them to claim all of the  non-refundable credits. Providing  the following information allows the software to determine if the 90% rule  applies when calculating the non-refundable tax credits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Canadian sourced income (excluding Part XIII</strong><strong>) they  earned when they were not a resident of Canada</strong>,such as income from an employer located&nbsp;in  Canada, income from a business carried on in Canada, or taxable  part of scholarships/fellowships/bursaries from Canada</li>
      <li><strong>Canadian source Part XIII </strong><strong>income PLUS  foreign sourced income they earned when they were not a resident of Canada</strong>, such as interest and dividends, rental income, pension income including  Old Age Security, Canada Pension Plan, and Quebec Pension Plan, and employment  income in another country</li>
  </ul>
    <h2 id="h9">Net income while living with their spouse or  common-law partner in Canada</h2>
    <p>When an  individual is already a resident of Canada for tax purposes and their spouse or  common-law partner becomes a newcomer, the individual must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>provide all their information slips and income for the full year</li>
      <li>confirm their net income for the period when they lived with their spouse  or common-law partner in Canada.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the individual is a  resident of Canada for tax purposes in 2022. Their spouse arrives in Canada as  a newcomer on July 1, 2022, so the individual provides his own net income for  the period between July 1 2022 and December 31 2022. This income is entered into  the <strong>Immigrant, emigrant or non-resident</strong> section of the tax  software.</p>

  <div class="col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 brdr-lft mrgn-bttm-md">
  <h3 class="h5 mrgn-tp-sm">Ufile tip</h3>
    <p>Generally, an individual and  their spouse or common-law partner arrive in Canada on the same date. If this  is the case, the tax software automatically claims any credits the couple may  be eligible for. </p>
	</div>
	</section>	 
<div class="clearfix"></div>
    <h2 id="h10">International students</h2>
    <p>Residency status for international  students is more complex because they may not establish significant residential  ties with Canada if they return to their home country on a periodic basis or  for a significant amount of time over the calendar year; or move to another  country when not attending university in Canada. It is up to the student to  determine their residency status for tax purposes.</p>
    <p> An international student is considered a newcomer only when they become a  new resident of Canada for tax purposes for the very first time.</p>
    <p> Newcomer status is not applied if the international student has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>been a resident of Canada for tax purposes for a full year</li>
      <li>previously  established themselves as a resident of Canada for tax purposes in a previous  year and then after any length of absence from Canada returned for another  semester and re-established residential ties</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="h11">Benefits and other credits</h2>
    <p>Newcomers may be eligible for benefits and credits such as the Goods and  services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credit and the Canada child benefit  (CCB). Refer the individuals to Are you eligible for benefits and credits?&nbsp; </p>
