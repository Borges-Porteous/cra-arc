<h3>Climate action incentive payment (CAIP)(45110)(schedule 14)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For residents of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Alberta only</li>
  <li>Prior to  2021, the climate action incentive was a <a href="../../glossary.html#rtc">refundable tax credit</a> claimed annually on the tax return, on line 45110 Climate  action incentive. It required a completed Schedule 14 to be submitted with the  tax return.</li>
  <li>As of 2021,  this credit is now known as the climate action incentive payment (CAIP). The CAIP is  paid as a quarterly benefit. If eligible, the individual automatically receives  this payment four times a year, starting in July 2022.The individual does not  need to apply for the CAIP as the CRA determines eligibility upon submission of  their tax return.</li>
      <li>As of the  2021 tax year, the credit is paid to the spouse or common-law partner whose tax return is assessed first. Although  individuals may choose not to claim the credit to make sure the spouse or  common-law partner receives it, we strongly recommend allowing the software to  claim the credit for everyone. This would ensure that if an individual&rsquo;s marital status  changes, they  should receive any CAIP they are entitled to. </li>
      <li>For the  purpose of the CAIP supplement for residents of small and rural communities,  individuals must have lived outside of a census metropolitan area (CMA) on  December 31 of the tax year. The software automatically  tick Box 60104  on Schedule  14 and submit it with the tax return. </li>
