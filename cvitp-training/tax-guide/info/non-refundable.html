          <ul>
            <li>Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate can be submitted online or by mail and must be completed  by a medical practitioner,&nbsp;confirming that the individual had a severe and  prolonged impairment in physical or mental function during the taxation year. </li>
            <li>If an individual is claiming the DTC and they do not already have an  approved T2201 on file for the year with CRA, it is in the individual&rsquo;s best  interest to submit the return without claiming the DTC and send the T2201 form  separately.</li>
            <li>The T2201 form has a section allowing the individual to specify whether  they would like the CRA to adjust their tax returns to reflect the disability  amount for themselves or their dependant under 18 years of age, if eligibility  is approved. After the application is approved, CRA will automatically adjust  their tax returns for all applicable years to include the federal and provincial disability amounts. However, the individual must send an adjustment request if:
            <ul>
              <li>they are claiming the disability amount for  a dependant 18 or older</li>
              <li>they are claiming the disability amount for  their spouse or common law partner</li>
              <li>the disability amount needs to be divided  between two or more supporting persons</li>
            </ul>
		</li>		
            <li>As a volunteer, you may explain to individuals that they should have Part A of the form filled in before meeting with their qualified medical practitioner, and Part B is to be completed by their qualified medical practitioner.</li>
