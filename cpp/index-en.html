		<p> The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a retirement plan you contribute to during your earning years. You contribute to the CPP from your annual income between a minimum and maximum amount. </p>

<p>On January 1, 2019, individuals started contributing more to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). We introduced this change, known as the CPP enhancement, to help workers increase their retirement income. </p>

			<p>Contributions will increase for most individuals in 2024.</p>

<p>If you have questions about the CPP enhancement</p>
	<h2>What the CPP enhancement is</h2>
<p>In 2019, we introduced the CPP enhancement to increase retirement benefits significantly. This was to help individuals save enough for retirement. We rolled out the enhancement in two phases.</p> 
<p>The first phase (2019-2023) saw incremental increases in contribution rate:</p> 
<ul> <li>employees and employers went from 4.95% to 5.95%</li>
<li>self-employed individuals went from 9.9% to 11.9%</li></ul>
<h2>Phase 2: 2024-2025</h2> 
<p>In 2024, the CPP contribution rate will still be:</p>
<ul> <li>employees and employers went from 4.95% to 5.95%</li>
<li>5.95% for employers and employees each</li>
<li>11.9% for self-employed individuals (the sum of what an employee and an employer would contribute)</li></ul>
<p>The amount you pay is based on your income. Income over a certain amount (a “ceiling”) is subject to a higher contribution rate. The first earning ceiling for 2022 is $64,900. Starting on January 1, 2024, we'll introduce a second higher ceiling called the <strong>year's additional maximum pensionable earnings</strong>. Phase 2 of the CPP enhancement will mainly affect individuals with a higher annual income.</p>
		<p>The amount for the second ceiling is:</p>
<ul> <li>based on the first ceiling
<li>set at 7% higher than the first ceiling for the first year</li>
<li>due to increase to 14% in 2025 and the following years</li></li></ul>
<p>If you earn above both ceilings, you'll contribute on the difference between the two ceilings:</p>
<ul> <li>the <strong>maximum pensionable earnings</strong> (first ceiling) and</li>
<li>the <strong>additional maximum pensionable Earning</strong> (second ceiling)</li></ul>
 
<p>If you earn more than the first ceiling but less than the second ceiling, you'll contribute on the difference between your earnings and <strong>maximum pensionable earnings</strong>.</p>
 
<p>If you earn less than the first ceiling, you'll contribute based on your earnings at that year's rate.</p>
  
	<p>In 2024, the <strong>second earnings</strong> ceiling CPP contribution rates will be:</p>
<ul><li>4% for employers and employees each
<li>8% for self-employed individuals (the sum of what an employee and an employer would contribute)</li></ul>
	
	<details><summary>Example: Employee (high-income earner)</summary>
<p>Maya is a high-income earner. She earns $150,000, more than the first ceiling ($67,700 in 2024) <strong>and</strong> the second ceiling ($72,439). In addition to her first contribution, her enhanced contribution would be ($72,439 - $67,700) x 4% = $189.56:</p>
		<ul><li>$72,439 (second ceiling)</li>
<li>minus $67,700 (first ceiling)</li>
<li>multiplied by 2024's enhanced contribution rate of 4%</li>
			<li>total enhanced annual contribution of $189.56</li></ul></details>

<details><summary>Example: Employee</summary>
<p>Diego’s annual income is below the first earnings ceiling ($67,700), he will only make contributions on the difference between the minimum earnings of $3,500 and his annual earnings of $45,000. He would only contribute as per 2024's first ceiling rate. No additional contribution would be necessary. The calculation would be ($45,000 - $3,500) × 5.95% = $2,469:</p>
<ul><li>$45,000 in annual earnings</li>
<li>minus $3,500 (ineligible deduction amount)</li>
<li>multiplied by 2024's first contribution rate of 5.95%</li>
<li>total annual contribution of $2,469</li></ul></details>

<details><summary>Example: Self-employed</summary>
<p>Ryan is self-employed and earns $70,000, more than the first ceiling ($67,700) but less than the second ceiling ($72,439). In addition to his first contribution, his enhanced contribution would be ($70,000 - $67,700) x 8% = $184:</p>
<ul><li>$70,000 in annual earnings</li>
<li>minus $67,700 (first ceiling)</li>
<li>multiplied by 2024's second contribution rate of 8%</li>
<li>total second annual contribution of $184</li></ul></details>
 
<details><summary>Employer</summary>
<p>Employers match their employees’ enhanced (2024) contribution rate of 4%.</p></details>
