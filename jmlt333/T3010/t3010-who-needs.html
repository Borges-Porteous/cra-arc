	   <p>Registered charities need to file a T3010 Return even if there was a change in their status, they made certain requests or they are in specific situations.  </p>

         <h2 id="rcmust">Registered charities who must file</h2>
	   <p><strong>All registered charities</strong> must file a T3010 Registered Charity Information Return to provide the CRA with the required information to remain compliant.</p>
	  
	   
       
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   <h3>Status changes to your charity</h3>
	   <p>The status of your charity may change, but you are still required to file your return.</p>
	   <details>
		  
	   <summary>If your charity was inactive</summary>
            <p>A charity is inactive if, during the entire fiscal year, it did not use any of its resources to carry out its charitable activities or to further its charitable purposes.</p>
         <p>If your charity was inactive for a fiscal year, you must still file a complete T3010 Return and explain why you were inactive in Section C: Question C2.</p>
		 <p>If you do not file your return, you risk losing your charitable status.</p>
		 <p>If you remain inactive, we may review your file to see if you still qualify for registration.</p>
	   </details>
	   <details>
		 <summary>If your charity is no longer operating</summary>
            <p>Even if your charity is no longer operating, you must still file an annual T3010 Return.</p>
		 <p>If your charity is no longer operating, you should ask for voluntary revocation of your registration. Once revocation is granted, you will no longer have to file a T3010 Return for any future fiscal period.</p>
		 <p>For more information, visit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/request-voluntary-revocation.html">Request voluntary revocation</a>.</p>
	   </details>
		
            <h3>Requests made by your charity</h3>
           <p>Some requests need approval by the CRA and can affect your return.</p>
		
			 <details>
				 <summary>Request to change fiscal year-end</summary>
				 <p>If you received approval to change your fiscal year-end, you will need to file a separate return for the months between your old fiscal year-end and the beginning of your new fiscal year.</p>
			 </details>
			 <details>
			
			      <summary>Request to accumulate funds</summary> 
				 <p>If you received approval to accumulate funds, report the amount accumulated during the fiscal year, including any income earned, on line 5500 and any accumulated funds spent on line 5510.</p>
			 </details>
	   
	 <h3 id="donot">If you do not file your return</h3> 
		       <p>If you do not file your return within 6 months of the end of your fiscal year we will start the revocation process for failure to file. We will send you a T2051A, Notice of Intention to Revoke a Charity's Registration, by registered mail.</p>
	        <p>If your charity's registration is revoked, you:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Can no longer issue official donation receipts</li>
		      <li>Are no longer exempt from paying income tax</li>
		      <li>Must give all of your remaining assests to an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/charities-giving-glossary.html#eligdon">eligible donee</a> or pay a revocation tax equal to the full value of your assets</li>
	      </ul> 
		 <h4>File an objection or appeal for the revocation process</h4>
		 <p>You have 45 days from the date of your notice to file your return and 90 days to file an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/objections-appeals-registered-charities-registered-canadian-amateur-athletic-associations-rcaaas-other-listed-qualified-donees.html">objection</a>.</p>
		 
		 <p>If you do not file an objection or appeal, or if it was unsuccessful, your charitable registration will be revoked. We will send you, by registered mail, a T2051B, Notice of Revocation of a Charity's Registration, which states the effective date of revocation.</p>
	   
         </section>
			 
			 <h2 id="special">Situations requiring additional forms</h2>
			      <h3>If your charity received approval for a disbursement quota reduction</h3> 
			 <p>If you received approval for a disbursement quota reduction, you must also file <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1240.html">Form T1240, Registered Charity Adjustment Request</a>, to correct the return for the fiscal year the shortfall occurred in.</p>
		     
		 
		
	 
            <h3>If your charity is incorporated in Ontario</h3>
           <p>If your charity is incorporated in Ontario and subject to the Ontario Not-for-profit Corporations Act, you must also file an Ontario annual information return.</p>
