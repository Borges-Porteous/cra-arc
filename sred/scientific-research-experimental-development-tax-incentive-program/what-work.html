</ul>
<h2 id="h1">Fundamental requirements of SR&amp;ED work</h2>
<p>SR&amp;ED work takes place in the fields of science and technology. Eligible work must meet certain fundamental requirements to be considered scientific research and experimental development.</p>
<p>Your reason for doing the work (why you started it) and the way in which you approac the work (how you carry it out) will help determine if the work is in fact SR&amp;ED. </p>
<p> Eligible SR&amp;ED work must include the 3 following items:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A scientific or technological <strong>uncertainty</strong> that you tried to overcome</li>
	<li>A systematic <strong>investigation or search</strong> that you carried out to overcome the uncertainty</li>
	<li>An <strong>advancement</strong> that you achieved or tried to achieve</li>
</ul>
<h3>The uncertainty </h3>
<p>SR&amp;ED work must be based on a  scientific or technological uncertainty that you are trying to overcome. </p>
<p> The uncertainty is the reason you  begin the SR&amp;ED work. It is the result of an issue you encounter in your  work that could not be resolved with the generally available <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scntfctchnlgclknwldg">scientific  or technological knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>  The uncertainty may exist because  of current shortcomings or limitations in science and technology. By trying to resolve  it, you&rsquo;re working towards a scientific or technological advancement. </p>
<p> You will need to be able to explain  the gap in the existing knowledge at the time you started the work and your  attempt to resolve it.  </p>
<h3><a>The investigation or [re]search</a></h3>
<p>The work you do in the tax year to try and  overcome the uncertainty must be carried out through experiment and analysis.  It is not a matter of using known design methods or established techniques.</p>
<p> The work must be a systematic investigation or [re]search.</p>
<p>  You must be able to explain the work that was done  or planned and describe how you gained the knowledge you needed to reach your goal.</p>
             
<details>             
<summary>What a systematic investigation includes</summary>
<ol>
  <li>The hypothesis:
    <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
      <li>The idea that triggered your  investigation to overcome the uncertainty. </li>
      <li>You may express this as a  possible solution to a problem, a proposed method, or an approach.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The experiment: 
    <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
      <li>the experiment and/or analysis  conducted to test your hypothesis/ idea. This may change or evolve as a result  of the testing.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The results obtained: </li>
      <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>The results or findings of the  experiment or analysis</li>
      </ol>      
    <li>The conclusions:
            <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
              <li>the logical conclusions based on  the results</li>
            </ol>    
      </li>
</ol>
</details>
    
<h3>The advancement</h3>
<p>The advancement is the increase in knowledge that  your SR&amp;ED work achieved. It&rsquo;s how the work improved the scientific or  technological knowledge base that existed at the start of the work. </p>
<p> By increasing scientific or technological  understanding, the advancement should move the knowledge base of your business  to a higher level.  </p>
<p> Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s the advancement in the  underlying science or technology that is important, not how the work advanced  your business or business practices.</p>
<p> You <strong>do not have to achieve your objective</strong> to gain new knowledge. </p>
<p> For example, if your work allowed you to  understand that the idea you tested is not a solution for your situation, this  can be considered new knowledge. </p>
<h2 id="h2">Eligible research and development work</h2>
<p>Work that is  eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives must be in the fields of science or  technology and must be carried out in Canada. Eligible types of work include  the following:</p>
<h3> Basic  research<strong></strong></h3>
<p>  The work you&rsquo;re  doing is working towards increasing the scientific or technological knowledge  base. Your work often takes place in laboratories and may be published in  scientific journals. </p>
<p> An example of basic  research is the study of a newly discovered virus to better understand its  characteristics.</p>
<h3>Applied research</h3>
<p>The work you&rsquo;re doing also increases scientific or  technological knowledge, but has a specific practical application in view. Like  basic research, your work often takes place in laboratories and may be published  in scientific journals.   </p>
<p> An example of applied research would be efforts to  develop a vaccine against a new virus by exploiting some identified  characteristics of that newly discovered virus.<strong></strong></p>
<h3>  Experimental  development<strong></strong></h3>
<p>  The work your doing increases scientific or  technological knowledge from research and more practical experience. Your work  is attempting to develop new or improved materials, devices, products or  processes.</p>
<p> An example of when experimental development could occur  might be during the scale up and optimization of processes to enable large  scale and rapid production of a vaccine.</p>
<h3>Eligible support work </h3>
<p><a>Support work is not SR&amp;ED, but  it may be eligible if it <strong>corresponds and directly supports the SR&amp;ED work</strong> you&rsquo;re doing. </a></p>
<p>  For example, if you  are developing a vaccine, you may perform tests on the virus to observe its  characteristics. This testing would be considered support work of your basic  research. </p>
<p> Types  of eligible support work: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a>engineering</a></li>
  <li>design</li>
  <li>operations research</li>
  <li>mathematical analysis</li>
  <li>computer programming</li>
  <li>data collection</li>
  <li>testing</li>
  <li>psychological research<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Work that is not eligible </h3>
<p><a>Some work is specifically excluded  from being eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives. Any work that is <strong>not  conducted specifically to </strong></a><strong>overcome  the uncertainty is not eligible</strong>. </p>
<details>             
<summary> Review types of excluded work</summary>
<p>  The following work  is <strong>not eligible</strong> or considered support work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Market research or sales promotion</li>
  <li>Quality control or routine testing of materials,  devices, products or processes</li>
  <li>Research in the social sciences or the  humanities</li>
  <li>Prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or  producing, minerals, petroleum or natural gas</li>
  <li>The commercial production of a new or improved  material, device or product or the commercial use of a new or improved process</li>
  <li>Style changes</li>
  <li>Routine data collection</li>
  <li>Acquiring available knowledge or know-how (for  example, through training) </li>
  <li>On-the-job learning, hiring expert employees or  consultants, or purchasing proprietary knowledge </li>
</ul>
</details>
<h2>If you receive other funding</h2>
<p>If you receive R&amp;D <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/summary-provincial-territorial-research-development-tax-credits-december-31-2016.html">tax  credits through your province or territory</a>, you may still claim SR&amp;ED  tax incentives, though it may reduce the amount you receive.</p>
<p> You must report any financial assistance you receive in your  SR&amp;ED expenditures claim.</p>
<h2 id="h3">Get support with eligibility </h2>
<h3>Assess the eligibility of your work</h3>
<p>Use the  Self-assessment and learning tool (SALT) to understand if your work may qualify  as SR&amp;ED work.</p>

<h3>Request a pre-claim consultation</h3>
<p>Request a  pre-claim consultation (PCC) to get support before you submit your claim. A PCC  can help you understand if a specific project is eligible for SR&amp;ED tax  incentives [or what types of expenditures are allowable].</p>
